## Fresh Perspectives: My Journey as a New Interior Designer in Adelaide CBD

Hello and welcome to my very first blog post! My name is Malik, and I’m thrilled to introduce myself as a recently graduated interior designer now working in the heart of Adelaide’s vibrant CBD.

### A New Chapter Begins

After years of study and hands-on experience at university, I’m excited to bring my passion for creative, functional spaces to Adelaide’s homes and businesses. The city’s unique blend of heritage architecture and modern living inspires me every day, and I’m eager to help clients transform their spaces into something truly special.

### What I Offer

As a new designer, I bring fresh ideas, up-to-date knowledge of the latest trends, and a keen eye for detail. Whether you’re looking to refresh your apartment, redesign your office, or create a welcoming retail environment, I’m here to help. My services include:

- Space planning and layout optimization
- Colour consultations and mood boards
- Furniture and decor selection
- Project management from concept to completion

### Why Choose a New Graduate?

Working with a recently graduated designer means you get someone who is enthusiastic, adaptable, and dedicated to exceeding your expectations. I pride myself on listening closely to my clients’ needs and delivering creative solutions that reflect their personality and lifestyle.
